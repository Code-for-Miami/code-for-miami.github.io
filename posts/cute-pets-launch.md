Animals in Miami-Dade County shelters are looking for a human to care for them. Code for Miami and Miami Dade Animal Services Department have created a new app, to share animal stories and help find them a new home. The automatic system sends out tweets four times a day with the listings currently on the Animal Services PetHarbor website on Miami Dade Animal Services twitter account, [@PetstoLove](https://twitter.com/petstolove) combined with content written by a staff member. 

With the use of the open source software and public county data, Code for Miami volunteers were able to implement the CutePets application originally created by the [Code for America Fellows team in Denver, CO](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/denver/). More than seven million animals enter animal shelters every year in the United States. With the help of simple applications like this that number can be greatly reduced. Any local government can implement their own version of this application by following the steps shown on the [Code for America CutePets GitHub page](https://github.com/codeforamerica/CutePets).

Share the @PetstoLove Twitter account with all your animal loving friends in the Miami-Dade area. If you live in another city or know others that do, share the CutePets project with them to make a difference in animalâ€™s life today.
