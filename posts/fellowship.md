Monday, November 3rd was a big day for the Code for Miami group. Besides it being the day before Election Day, we had some big moves going on. 

We had some visitors from the national organization Code for America visiting Miami to meet with Miami-Dade official as Miami has been chosen as a partner city for the Code for America Fellowship Program. That means Miami-Dade Government will be working directly with the selected Fellows “develop civic applications that will strive to improve how people interact with the Regulatory and Economic Resources department.”

Speaking of the Code for America Fellowship, our own Ernie Hsiung has been selected as a 2015 Fellow! This means for 2015 Ernie will be based in San Francisco and then the city to which he is assigned to work on civic applications. We congratulate Ernie on this great opportunity and wish him the best of luck! 

Cristina Solana will be the interim Co-Captain of Code for Miami! While Ernie is away, Cristina will help Rebekah in running Code for Miami meetups and events. 

We wish the Best for Ernie and Cristina in their new roles and look forward for what’s coming up in 2015 for Code for Miami!
