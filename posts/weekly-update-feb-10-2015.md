Yay! It’s our first blog post here on tumblr! :) Rebekah and Ernie, our co-organizers, have been working hard to put together fruitful meetings and pizza for our hungry stomachs and minds.

Coming up this month we will be hosting the Open Data Jam at The Lightbox on Feb 22. We’ll be talking about our plans and ideas for open government data. Also, if you haven’t seen it, [Code for Miami was on the front page of Diario las Americas](http://www.diariolasamericas.com/locales/piratas-ciberneticos-ayudan-gobierno-miami-dade.html). We are happy to be getting exposure in diverse communities!

2014 is starting off with a bang with a bunch of great projects to work on. We need people to start giving us some raw data for [Text My Bus](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/mdt-bus-sms/wiki/About-the-Project). So if you want to perform a small test and give us back the results that would help us determine if the stickers are working properly. We’re seeing lots of improvement with the Local Business Tax Data Set. [Open311](http://www.open311.org/) is gaining a lot of traction. The [Miami Local Wiki](https://localwiki.org/miami/) has gotten some new content and you can always add more.

As always, we thank you all for the efforts you put into these projects. Let’s work together to make a difference!
