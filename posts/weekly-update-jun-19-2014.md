We have a diverse group in todayâ€™s meet! 

Artists, Health Care Enthusiasts, Animal Rights and Activists against Human Trafficking all come together on working towards solving problems in Miami Dade County and South Florida.

We want to take a moment to say goodbye to one of our core members, Xavier Hayeck. Xavier is moving to San Francisco to start a new journey so we thank him for his efforts and wish him the best of luck!

With that being said, we are still going strong here at Code for Miami! Our brigade Co-Captain, Ernie Hsiung, is looking to apply for Code for Miami Fellowship. Hopefully that means big things going forward for Civic Hacking in South Florida!

Our current projects include working on sending information from RepMiami to Google so we can share information of politicians on the municipal level and do our part towards open data in politics.

We are also working on mural project in Wynwood (and throughout Miami) documenting murals and paintings throughout the city and the stories of the artists behind them.
