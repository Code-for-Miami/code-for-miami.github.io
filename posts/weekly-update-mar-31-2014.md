Every week we manage to get some bright and caring individuals together to work and brainstorm projects to help our community. This meeting, marking the end of the first quarter shows we done a lot of work but there is still so much we can do.

RepMiami is currently in testing stages to see if there are any bugs. But for the most part is complete. Great work, Miguel!
We are currently waiting for some backside development from the county for the Open 311 application. In the meantime, Greg Bloom is currently working on an Open 211 initiative with [openreferral.org](http://openreferral.org/). This is to direct people to non-government businesses for any services they may require. They are working with Switchboard Miami, Miami’s current 211 provider, on how to best make this data open and searchable.

There has been a lot of local and media interest for the bicycle tracking app, ‘Dude, Where’s My Bike.’ We’re hoping to get this further into development in the coming weeks.
We had a visit this week from Jase Wilson, brigade captain of Code for Kansas City. Also with us was Rob Davis, brigade captain of Code for Ft. Lauderdale. It’s always great to get together and discuss how throughout the country our Code for America brigades are working towards open government.

Rob is currently working on the Florida Legislation Tracker which will work towards tracking and identifying the latest bills and legislation passed by Florida Lawmakers. Once it is completed, it will help citizens understand and track legislation with issues they find important.

Remember the next two weeks are going to be a little different than our usual meetings. Monday, April 7 our own Adrian Cardenas will present “[Learning the Command Line](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Miami/events/169993832/),” a beginners talk for folks that want to understand more about the interfaces behind Unix/Unix-like systems and command line utilities. April 14th we will be user testing the text my bus app. There will be two separate testing groups at Dadeland South Station and Government Center Metro Rail Station.

As always, thanks for all the work everyone puts into making our community better. Let’s get coding!
