Tomorrow, we will be our hosting our first, Open Data Jam at The Light Box. This is really exciting because this is our chance to show local officials we are serious about data transparency in our government.

Open Data is the idea that government (local, national, or international) should allow individuals access to certain types of data. If this information was open, citizens would be able to better understand what is going on and how they can contribute. 

An example of how open data helps us is the National Weather Service. Because they distribute this information, developers can make programs with 10-day forecasts based on your location and even simple apps like seeing if it will rain today. This information has helped launch a variety of business models from The Weather Channel to Weather Bug. 

This kind of information is vital for citizens to create a productive environment. And the more information we have access to, the better our community can run and develop. There are many different data sets we hope will become available such as Election Results, Crime Statistics, Property Data, Information for Hunting and Fishing and so much more.

We invite you to brainstorm with us on what kind of information we need and we can use this data to help our community become more secure and more efficient. Remember, no idea is too small! We hope to see you tomorrow at the Open Data Jam!
